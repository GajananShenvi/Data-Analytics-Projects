# 🌍 Global COVID-19 Situation Overview

This project provides a comprehensive overview of the global COVID-19 pandemic using data analysis and visualization tools. It combines Python for data cleaning and processing with Power BI for interactive dashboard creation.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Analyze global COVID-19 case data (confirmed cases, deaths, vaccinations, etc.)
- Visualize key metrics and trends across countries and time
- Deliver actionable insights to understand the pandemic’s impact

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: Data cleaning, transformation, and processing (pandas, numpy)
- **Power BI**: Dashboard design and data visualization
- **Excel/CSV**: Source data files

## 📊 Features

- Interactive dashboards showing:
  - Daily and cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths
  - Country-wise comparisons and trends
  - Vaccination progress by region
- Filters for date, country, and case type
- KPIs and visual charts for quick insight

  ## 🧪 How It Works

1. Raw COVID-19 datasets are imported and cleaned using Python (pandas).
2. Cleaned data is exported to CSV format for use in Power BI.
3. Power BI is used to model data, create measures using DAX, and build visualizations.
4. Insights are drawn based on trends, spikes, and country comparisons.
